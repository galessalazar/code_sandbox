A personal playground for practicing algorithms, data structures, and coding challenges.  
This repo is a place to experiment, learn, and track progress over time.
## Structure


- `easy/` – beginner-level challenges
- `medium/` – intermediate challenges
- `hard/` – advanced challenges (coming soon)


## Usage
Each file contains a standalone problem solution with comments explaining the approach.  
To run a solution (example in JavaScript):
``` 
node easy/01-hello-world.js
```
## Goals
- Build consistency through practice
- Strengthen problem-solving skills
- Document progress for future reference
